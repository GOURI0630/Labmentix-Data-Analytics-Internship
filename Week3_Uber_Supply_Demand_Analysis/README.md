Week 3 – Uber Supply–Demand Gap Analysis 🚗📊

Project Objective:
Analyze Uber ride request data to identify the supply–demand gap, visualize trip patterns, and derive insights for improving driver allocation and user satisfaction.

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization & Time-Series Analysis

Key Steps:

Cleaned and formatted timestamps

Engineered time-based features (hour, time-slot, day type)

Analyzed demand patterns by pickup point

Visualized supply vs demand trends

Identified major causes for supply shortages

Key Insights:

Peak demand occurs during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–8 PM).

Airport pickup points have the highest number of unfulfilled requests.

Optimizing driver allocation during peak hours can reduce cancellations and improve ride availability.

Outcome:
Developed actionable insights to balance supply and demand, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction.
